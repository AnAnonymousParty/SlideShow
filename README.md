# SlideShow
node.js Slide Show app.

Displays an image randomly selected from a (configurable) directory for a
(configurable) amount of time before displaying another image. 

Subdirectories are automatically included.

When an image is clicked, options are presented to advance to the next image,
move the image to an alternate directory to remove it from the rotation so
that it can be later archived or deleted, and access a settings page that
allows the selection of the image and alternate directories and set the delay
between images.
